  ## About me

  
content: >
  ### I design and provide educational services for healthcare patients and high school students.

  I love to interact with people and learn from individual experiences. I have an interest in
  simplifying complex decision making and find easy and better solutions to solve seemingly difficult problems. I always
  try my best to provide good, honest guidance and feedback. I have been working as a health educator since 2019.
